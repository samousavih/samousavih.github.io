# Background

When we get here lots of things must have gone wrong, the way I see it before we get here we should go through a check list and make sure non would work

1) Automation tests
2) Pair programming
3) Quality check list
4) Reviews


# Why it is a conversation we shouldn't have?
1) Blame game
2) Slow
3) Context Switches
4) Unhappy devs

# Experience from the last one
