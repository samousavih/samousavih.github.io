        <p>I am a full time Software Engineer, graduated with a master degree in 2013. I have tried variety of tech and languages including BASIC, C, C++, Java, JavaScript and C#. One of the very first code I wrote was a virus in BASIC which I ran on my school's computer to see how viruses work. Luckily that curiosity didn't end in a disaster.
    I am curious about all aspects of software. I love to understand complex stuff deeper and explain them to others in very simple terms.</p>
